  ## User Experience (UX)

  ### User Stories

  #### First time visiting the site

  - As a first-time visitor, I aim to quickly find recommended equipment from Amazon for my needs.

  - As a new visitor, I expect to effortlessly discover top-rated equipment sourced from Amazon.

  #### Freaquent Visitor

  - I want to find different equipment from amazon and for a better price

## Design

For this project, I've opted for a minimalist approach, employing a carefully curated palette of three distinct colors. These colors were chosen to evoke a sense of simplicity and elegance while ensuring visual harmony throughout the design.

### Colour Scheme

I have used the following colors:

| Colour         | Hex                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example Colour | ![#0a192f](https://via.placeholder.com/10/0a192f?text=+) #0a192f |
| Example Colour | ![#024bc0](https://via.placeholder.com/10/024bc0?text=+) #024bc0 |
| Example Colour | ![#f4f4f6](https://via.placeholder.com/10/f4f4f6?text=+) #f4f4f6 |

### Typography

I have used google fonts library to import the fonts on my website and the main font on site is "Poppins", followed by "sans-serif" .

![Poppins font example](assets/documentation/Poppins-Font-1.webp)

I laso used "font-awesome" library, for icons like instagram, x, tiktok, menu icons etc.
![Font-Awesome socials example](assets/documentation/socialsicons.png)
![Font-Awesome NavBar example](assets/documentation/navbaricons.png)
![Font-Awesome Home example](assets/documentation/homepageicon.png)

### Imagery

I chose a background image featuring two people working out from home to inspire and resonate with visitors, promoting the accessibility and relevance of our content.

![Background image](assets/images/home-workouts-1.avif)

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop using Balsamiq.

![Mobile wireframes](assets/documentation/IphoneBalsamiq.png)
![Desktop wireframes](assets/documentation/DesktopBalsamiq.png)

### Features

Explore our site with four visible pages and a hidden "thankyou.html" page, accessible after form completion.
Also the page has a "back to homepage" button to be more visible for the visitors to go on the home page. This button works well for the mobile version because you don't see the "Home" button on the nav bar after completing the form.
![Thank you Page](assets/documentation/thankyou.png)

![Thank you Mobile Page ](assets/documentation/thankyoumobile.png)

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

1. A logo, when pressed will return you to the home page
2. A Nav Bar, which will change when using on a mobile device.

- This is the desktop version of the nav bar.
  ![NavBar Desktop](assets/documentation/navbardesktop.png)

- This is the mobile version of the nav bar.
  ![NavBar Mobile](assets/documentation/navbarmobile.png)

- On the mobile version, I have used a script to hide it when the "x" icon is pressed, and pop the pages when the "navigation" icon is pressed.

3. Every page will display a pointer cursor

### The Home Page

The home page has a "Start Now" button, which is very important for the website, when pressed, this button will bring visitors on the equipment page.
![Home Page](assets/documentation/homepage.png)

Also the home page has a short "About Us" section down below.

### The ContactUs Page

The Contact Us Page has three things, a form where people ask questions, a map and contact details.
![Contact Us Page](assets/documentation/contactus.png)

### The Blog Page

On the Blog page I have written the following 3 articles

- 10 Tips for Effective Workouts
- The Importance of Nutrition in Fitness
- 5 Effective Ways to Stay Motivated During Your Workouts

![Blog Page](assets/documentation/blog.gif)

### The Equipment Page

The Equipment page has images and links, when clicked, this link will send people directly to amazon website.

![Equipment Page](assets/documentation/equipment.png)

### The ThankYou Page

The "thank you" page is the only page that is not visible initially. It will appear after the client completes the form on the "Contact Us" page.

![Thank you Page](assets/documentation/thankyou.png)

### Future Implementations

#### I would like to add on my website the following things:

- Login script
- Nutrition plans
- Exercises explained

### Accessibility

1. Alt Text for images

- All images used on this website has an alt text, providing users with screen readers and those with visual impairments with information about the content and purpose of the images.

2. Semantic HTML

3. Hover on all buttons so people know they're about to click on something, also, on this website, the button changes the colour when the mouse is on it.

4. Form Accesibility

- Form on this project inculude appropiate labes and placeholder text.
