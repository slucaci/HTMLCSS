## Design

For this project, I've opted for a minimalist approach, employing a carefully curated palette of three distinct colors. These colors were chosen to evoke a sense of simplicity and elegance while ensuring visual harmony throughout the design.

### Colour Scheme

I have used the following colors:

| Colour         | Hex                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example Colour | ![#0a192f](https://via.placeholder.com/10/0a192f?text=+) #0a192f |
| Example Colour | ![#024bc0](https://via.placeholder.com/10/024bc0?text=+) #024bc0 |
| Example Colour | ![#f4f4f6](https://via.placeholder.com/10/f4f4f6?text=+) #f4f4f6 |

### Typography

I have used google fonts library to import the fonts on my website and the main font on site is "Poppins", followed by "sans-serif" .

### Imagery

I chose a background image featuring two people working out from home to inspire and resonate with visitors, promoting the accessibility and relevance of our content.
